## Updating Studio

In contrast to certain other engines, every experience runs on the latest version of the Roblox engine. You should keep Studio up-to-date to utilize the latest APIs and features.

If your current version of Studio is outdated, you'll see an **Update Available** button in the upper-right corner. Clicking the button will prompt you to save/close the currently open place so that Studio can automatically update and restart.
